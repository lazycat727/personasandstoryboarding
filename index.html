  <p><h2>Exploration of an Elevator Interface using Personas and Storyboarding</h2></p>

  <h4>This is the elevator interface in my dorm's elevator. In order to go up from the first floor, you must swipe your 
    brown id card and then press the button of the desired floor. To go down, you can simply just press the button of what 
    floor you want. It's purpose is to provide a level of security in going up to the different floors so that only people who
    live there have access to the floors.</h4><br>

        <p>Observations of Users Interacting with the Interface: 
        </p>
        <p>-Most users had a fairly easy time interacting with the interface, likely due to lots of experience with using it already. 
        </p>
        <p>-One interesting observation was whether users elected to press the "close door" button, and if they did, whether they pressed 
          the correct one (there are 2, one for the front door and one for the back door).</p>
       </div>

      <div class="well">
        <p>Questions:</p>
        <p>1. How easy or difficult did you find this interface to use? If it was difficult, what about it was confusing or made it hard to understand?</p>
        <p>2. If you were using this interface for the first time, do you think you would be able to successfully figure out what to do? Why or why not?</p>
        <p>3. If you could change one or multiple things about the interface, what would you change?</p>
       </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <div class="well">
       <p>Summarized Responses:</p>
       <p>-Almost all users said using it was easy since they had already done it a lot and they didn't even have to think about it.
         However, most people also said that when they used it for the first time, it was somewhat confusing to realize that you had to swipe
         your card in order to access the buttons. 
       </p>
       <p>
         -Users had a variety of different things they would change. One individual suggested removing the need to swipe your card at all, since
         the elevator room already had a door behind a card swipe. Another suggested making the close and open door buttons more clear. 
         A third said they would prefer if the interface was higher up so they didn't have to reach down to interact with it.
